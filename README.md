# Fiat Picker

Fiat Picker is a 3D web configurator that lets you customize the colors of a Fiat 500 Abarth directly in your browser. It’s designed to be a simple, lightweight tool to visualize the car with different paint jobs and in various environments.

### What it does
The app provides an interactive 3D model that you can rotate and zoom. Key features include:
* **Color Customization:** You can choose a single color for the whole car or switch to "Two colors" mode to paint the roof and body separately.
* **Environment Swapping:** Change the background to see how the car's reflections and lighting change in different settings (city, mountains, seaside, etc.).
* **Your Own Backdrop:** Import a photo of your own and frame it: a movable, zoomable window with the same aspect ratio as the browser window decides which part of the photo stays visible behind the car.
* **Snap a Photo:** There is a dedicated button to take a high-quality screenshot of your configuration and save it to your device.
* **Language Support:** The interface is available in both English and Italian.

### How it works
The project is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The 3D engine is powered by **Three.js**, which handles the scene rendering, lighting, and the GLTF model loading.

The code is organized into a few main parts:
* `configurator.js` contains the logic for the 3D scene, material updates, and the screenshot system.
* `i18n.js` manages the text translations.
* `style.css` handles the UI layout, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

To get realistic reflections on the car's paint, I used a PMREM (Prefiltered Mipmapped Radiance Environment Map) generator that simulates real-world lighting based on the environment.
